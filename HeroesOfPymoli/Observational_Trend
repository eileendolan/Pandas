Heroes of Pymoli â€“ Observational Trends


1)	After analyzing user data from a video game company, I analyzed data from players who made in-game purchases.
I saw that my results for gender demographics showed that males were most likely to buy the game and make in-app purchases.
Although women had much lower results, I do think it is a notable result. 

2)	Another observational trend were that people ages 20-24 and 15-19 were most likely to make gaming purchases. 
However, players 40 and plus years are most likely not to buy games.


3)	The most popular and the most profitable item is the Oathbreaker.
It topped the five most popular list and the top five most profitable list. 
Although, I am content with the data results, I would have liked to see what
the gender and age groups are of the players who purchased the most popular and most purchased items. 
These are some things to do in a further analysis.
